The only difference between an i5 3570k and an i7 3770k is that the i7 3770k is 100MHz faster and has Hyperthreading. Games right now do not use Hyperthreading. If you want my advice, buy an i5 3570k which will be cooler (And overclock better) than an i7 3770k. With the $100 you save, upgrade to a GTX\ufeff 670 or 680 :) Hyperthreading is good for video rendering BUT the cuda cores in your GPU do that as well.",
